[![wormboy button](assets/button.png)](https://wormboy3.neocities.org/)

i am making this git repo public because i love to peruse the source of my favorite sites, and i hope that this may make that easier for others to see mine.

> of course don't steal my code dummy. please learn from it, but this is my site.


## notes
the site's js is compiled typescript. here are my `tsconfig.json` compiler options:
```json
    "target": "ES2021",
    "module": "es6",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "outDir": "./js/",
    "strict": true,
    "strictNullChecks": false,
    "skipLibCheck": true      
```
these settings may not be for everyone, but they work for me.
