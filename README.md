this site is my silly neocities for silly things :]! see it live at the link above [wormboy button]/

note: the repo and live site may not always match 1:1. updates may be offset from one another, but i'll be publishing updates as regularly as i feel appropriate.

i am making this git repo public because i love to peruse the source of my favorite sites, and i hope that this may make that easier for others to see mine.

> of course don't steal my code dummy. please learn from it, but this is my site.


## notes

the site's js is compiled typescript. here are my `tsconfig.json` compiler options:
```json
    "target": "ES2021",
    "module": "es6",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "outDir": "site/assets/js/",
    "strict": true,
    "strictNullChecks": false,
    "skipLibCheck": true      
```
these settings may not be for everyone, but they work for me.

to build my site, i work in vs code and i use an extension called live server to locally host. [todo: make a page talkinga bout all this.]
