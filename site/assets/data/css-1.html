<p>this is a brief tutorial to introduce you to the wonder if defining <code>:root</code> variables in your css file.</p>

<p>this tutorial assumes:</p>
<ul>    
    <li>you understand the basics of html/css usage and syntax.</li>
    <li>you understand how css relates to html.</li>
</ul>

<p>does YOUR css look like THIS?!??!</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
body {
    background-color: #66b3ff;
    color: #f2f2ff;
    font-family: 'fonty mcfontface', monospace;
}

div {
    background-color: #161654;
    border: 2px solid #f2f2ff;
    color: #66b3ff;
}

p.style-1 {
    color: #161654;
}
</code></pre>

<p class="whisper">to be clear: there is NOTHING wrong with this. this works. this is good! no idea what it looks like rendered, cuz i am making shit up for this tutorial, but there is nothing wrong with the format, it's totally normal and functional css.</p>

<p>but it is a tad.... JUVENILE. notice how we have 3 different hex colors to keep track of? and 3 is a low number. looking at <code>#161654</code> means nothing unless you're insane. you could maybe guesstimate that <code>#f2f2ff</code> is a very light blue. but who has time for that!!</p> 

<p>furthermore: what about when you want to update a color? you COULD search and replace, and there is nothing wrong with that. however not all text editors have this option, and i forget the shortcuts all the time.</p>

<p>there is a way in css to create variables, or "labels", for your colors.</p>

<p>at the very top of your file, you're going to use the <code>:root</code> selector. this is where we can declare global variables for css styling! here is our example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
:root {
    --light-blue: #f2f2ff;
    --mid-blue: #66b3ff;
    --dark-blue: #161654;
}
</code></pre>

<div class="notes">
    <p>starting a variable with <code>--</code> is an important convention to prevent clashing with built-in css variables! additionally, variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that <code>--MY-VAR</code> will be different from <code>--my-var</code> will be different from <code>--My-Var</code> will be differrnt from <code>--mY-vAR</code>! <span class="whisper">but those wouldn't be very practical names...</span></p>
</div>

<p>this snippet would go at the top of our code from before, and i'll refactor the uses of these colors. to use a variable, you call the css <code>var()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
:root {
    --light-blue: #f2f2ff;
    --mid-blue: #66b3ff;
    --dark-blue: #161654;
}

body {
    background-color: var(--mid-blue);
    color: var(--light-blue);
    font-family: 'fonty mcfontface', monospace;
}

div {
    background-color: var(--dark-blue);
    border: 2px solid var(--light-blue);
    color: var(--mid-blue);
}

p.style-1 {
    color: var(--dark-blue);
}
</code></pre>

<p>yay! now we have an easy-to-maintain color palette.</p>

<hr class="checkpoint">

<p>these variables can apply to other values, too!</p>

<p>let's say that we have a handful of fonts for a website. let's say we have three: one for the headers, one for most everything else, and then a third for finer print. our css could look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
body {
    font-family: 'fonty mcfontface', sans-serif;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: 'angelbaby handwriting', cursive;
}

.other, .misc, .selectors {
    font-family: 'fine print', monospace;
}
</code></pre>

<p>wherein we select multiple elements at once just to say they all share a font. <span class="whisper">again, nothing wrong with this, preference is key, but i want to share these tricks.</span></p>

<p>or we could do this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
:root {
    --body-font: 'fonty mcfontface', sans-serif;
    --fancy-font: 'angelbaby handwriting', cursive;
    --extra-font: 'fine print', monospace;
}
    
body {
    font-family: var(--body-font);
    ...
    ...
}

h1 {
    font-family: var(--fancy-font);
    ...
    ...
}

...

.misc {
    font-family: var(--extra-font);
}

...
</code></pre>

<p>and sprinkle our variables throughout our css file. a bunch of points that all tie back to a single, editable value.</p>

<hr class="checkpoint">

<p>along with <code>var()</code> as a css variable, we have <code>calc()</code>. let's look at basic example usage of <code>calc()</code>: imagine we want an element's width to be just 5 pixels under half the total width available. that could be easily and flexibly achieved like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
.element-class {
    width: calc(50% - 5px);
}
</code></pre>

<p>what makes <code>calc()</code> important is that it allows us to modify some variables a bit. i found this out when i wanted to have a base hex color and use variations for different elements. it wasn't as easy as typing <code>var(--accent-color)de</code>, tacking on two letters to indicate the <code>aa</code> value of a <code>#rrggbbaa</code> color.</p>

<p>it turns out that <code>var(--my-number-var)px</code> does not output <code>5px</code>. <span class="whisper">where <code>--my-number-var</code> is set to 5...</span> instead, it outputs <code>5 px</code>, the whitespace being lethal to functional css.</p>

<p>this final section is mostly a word of warning, or at least where my own struggle remains. i'll probably be updating this soon enough, as i learn more. <span class="whisper">also because i'm sure i'll nitpick all night.</span></p>
