<p>speaking of the browser. let's talk about how to use the inspect panel in a browser. it isn't as scary as it seems. what makes it scary is how convoluted big sites' [youtube, reddit, instagram, the big ones] html is. to get some practice, try inspecting someone's neocities. <a href="https://neocities.org/browse?sort_by=random">here's some random sites</a>.</p>

<div class="notes">
    <p><code>f12</code> will open the inspect panel in most browsers. in firefox, you can also use <code>right click + q</code>!</p>
</div>

<p>let's open the "inspect" panel. this is typically the first panel, which lets you surf the html contents of the page. as you mouse over each element, it should be highlighted in blue on the page. click on one! next to the html text, there should be another panel labelled "rules". this will display the css rules that apply to the selected element!!! hover over different properties -- you can enable/disable, edit, and use this to debug!</p>

<p>there should be another tab next to "rules"--"layout". here i will introduce you to the box model.</p>

<img src="assets/images/tutorials/web_box_model.png" alt="css box model">
<p class="whisper centered">the holy box model.</p>

<p>this box model goes beyond broswer inspection! this box model is key to understanding block elements in css.</p>

<p>in this model, there are 5 layers. starting from the inside out:</p>

<ol>
    <li>blue: the box's content. the text or image. the size of this box is determined by the element's height/width properties.</li>
    <li>purple: padding. this is some blank space around the element's content, <em>but within the block</em>, that gives the text or image some breathing room from...</li>
    <li>grey line: the border. this is the "outline" around an element. <span class="whisper">for example, the little purple outlined boxes on my tutorial pages, or the purple lines bordering this main box.</span> the thickness of the border does change the element's size, as does the padding.</li>
    <li>yellow: margin. this is the blank space <em>outside</em> the element and its border. <span class="whisper">for example, the space between paragraphs is a margin.</span> this creates breathing room between elements, and it can also center a block on a page! <span class="whisper">horizontally, at least. that's what <code>auto</code> does.</span></li>
    <li>black: the element's overall position on the page. where it's placed. depending on the element, this ring might not always have printed numbers like in the image above.</li>
</ol>

<p>visualizing web elements and css properties this way can get tricky, but it's key to having control over what you write and make.</p>

<p>it is also great help in debugging. why is my element so wide? oh that's right, i styled this element type this way.</p>

<p>this is something that has a lot to it, i'm gonna return to writing this tutorial later! it's my birthday today and i don't wanna!</p>
